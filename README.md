# Order Confirmation Demo

## Project Description

This project is a simple demonstration of an order confirmation comparison tool. It showcases how orders and their corresponding confirmations can be visually compared side by side.

### Key Features:

- Side-by-side display of order and confirmation details
- Highlighting of discrepancies
- Expandable line items for detailed comparison
- Microsoft Office-inspired user interface

Please note: This is a concept demonstration only and is not intended for production use. It serves as a starting point for discussions on improving order verification processes.# OrderConfirmationDemo
